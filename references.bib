  abstract = {We construct 2D and 3D finite element de Rham sequences of arbitrary polynomial degrees with extra smoothness. Some of these elements have nodal degrees of freedom and can be considered as generalisations of scalar Hermite and Lagrange elements. Using the nodal values, the number of global degrees of freedom is reduced compared with the classical N\'ed\'elec and Brezzi\textendash Douglas\textendash Marini finite elements, and the basis functions are more canonical and easier to construct. Our finite elements for \$\$\{H\}(\textbackslash mathrm \{div\})\$\$with regularity \$\$r=2\$\$coincide with the nonstandard elements given by Stenberg~(Numer Math 115(1):131\textendash 139,~2010). We show how regularity decreases in the finite element complexes, so that they branch into known complexes. The standard de Rham complexes of Whitney forms and their higher order version can be regarded as the family with the lowest regularity. The construction of the new families is motivated by finite element systems.},

  abstract = {Differential complexes such as the de Rham complex have recently come to play an important role in the design and analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations. The design of stable discretizations of systems of partial differential equations often hinges on capturing subtle aspects of the structure of the system in the discretization. In many cases the differential geometric structure captured by a differential complex has proven to be a key element, and a discrete differential complex which is appropriately related to the original complex is essential. This new geometric viewpoint has provided a unifying understanding of a variety of innovative numerical methods developed over recent decades and pointed the way to stable discretizations of problems for which none were previously known, and it appears likely to play an important role in attacking some currently intractable problems in numerical PDE.},

  abstract = {The mixed variational formulation of many elliptic boundary value problems involves vector valued function spaces, like, in three dimensions, H(curl;Omega) and H(Div,Omega). Thus finite element subspaces of these function spaces are indispensable for effective finite element discretization schemes. Given a simplicial triangulation of the computational domain Omega, among others, Raviart, Thomas and N39d39lec have found suitable conforming finite elements foH(Div;Omega) and H(curl;Omega). At first glance, it is hard to detect a common guiding principle behind these approaches. We take a fresh look at the construction of the finite spaces, viewing them from the angle of differential forms. This is motivated by the well-known relationships between differential forms and differential operators: div, curl and grad can all be regarded as special incarnations of the exterior derivative of a differential form. Moreover, in the realm of differential forms most concepts are basically dimension-independent. Thus, we arrive at a fairly canonical procedure to construct conforming finite element subspaces of function spaces related to differential forms. In any dimension we can give a simple characterization of the local polynomial spaces and degrees of freedom underlying the definition of the finite element spaces. With unprecedented ease we can recover the familiar H(Div;Omega)- and H(curl;Omega)-conforming finite elements, and establish the unisolvence of degrees of freedom. In addition, the use of differential forms makes it possible to establish crucial algebraic properties of the canonical interpolation operators and representation theorems in a single sweep for all kinds of spaces.},

  abstract = {This article reports on the confluence of two streams of research, one emanating from the fields of numerical analysis and scientific computation, the other from topology and geometry. In it we consider the numerical discretization of partial differential equations that are related to differential complexes so that de Rham cohomology and Hodge theory are key tools for exploring the well-posedness of the continuous problem. The discretization methods we consider are finite element methods, in which a variational or weak formulation of the PDE problem is approximated by restricting the trial subspace to an appropriately constructed piecewise polynomial subspace. After a brief introduction to finite element methods, we develop an abstract Hilbert space framework for analyzing the stability and convergence of such discretizations. In this framework, the differential complex is represented by a complex of Hilbert spaces, and stability is obtained by transferring Hodge-theoretic structures that ensure well-posedness of the continuous problem from the continuous level to the discrete. We show stable discretization is achieved if the finite element spaces satisfy two hypotheses: they can be arranged into a subcomplex of this Hilbert complex, and there exists a bounded cochain projection from that complex to the subcomplex. In the next part of the paper, we consider the most canonical example of the abstract theory, in which the Hilbert complex is the de Rham complex of a domain in Euclidean space. We use the Koszul complex to construct two families of finite element differential forms, show that these can be arranged in subcomplexes of the de Rham complex in numerous ways, and for each construct a bounded cochain projection. The abstract theory therefore applies to give the stability and convergence of finite element approximations of the Hodge Laplacian. Other applications are considered as well, especially the elasticity complex and its application to the equations of elasticity. Background material is included to make the presentation self-contained for a variety of readers.},
